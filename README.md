# bb-tw Project

## Introduction
The "bb-tw" project is an educational application designed to showcase interactions with chat functionalities, Telegram bots, and Twitter APIs. It provides a practical example for students and developers to learn about building and connecting various system components within a Node.js framework.

## Learning Objectives
- Comprehend the architecture of a Node.js application.
- Learn how to establish an API server to manage HTTP requests.
- Integrate with external services like Telegram and Twitter for real-world applications.
- Apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques using tools such as Word2Vec.
- Perform data analysis for relevance and temperature metrics in different contexts.
- Utilize Docker for containerizing applications and simplifying deployment processes.

## Features
- **API Server** (`api-server.js`): Handles incoming HTTP requests and provides responses.
- **ChatGPT Integration** (`chatgpt.js`): Implements a conversational AI interface.
- **Telegram Bot** (`connectTelegram.js` and `telegram-server.js`): Connects to the Telegram platform and interacts with users via a bot.
- **Twitter Data Analysis** (`twitterRelevance.js`): Analyzes Twitter data streams for relevance.
- **Word2Vec NLP** (`word2vec.js`): Demonstrates the use of Word2Vec for processing and understanding text data.
- **Data Analysis Tools** (`relevance.js` and `temperature.js`): Provides scripts for assessing various data metrics.
- **Docker Support** (`Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`): Guides users through creating and managing Docker containers.
